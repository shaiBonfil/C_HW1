# Welcome
This repository is made to document the work being made on the different files required for the first assignment in the C programming language class at Ariel University (2020)

## About The Program
The program we were asked to write implements simple mathemic calculations when given an input from the user.

## How To Run
One of the files included in this repository is a makefile, used to compile programs written in C. 
In order to use our makefile you have to have a way to run unix terminal commands, e.g. macOS, Linux or a virtual machine running a unix machine.

1. Download the files in this repository.
2. Place the files in an empty folder and remember the location of this folder.
3. Open Terminal (on macOS you can use cmnd+space to start Spotlight Search and type in 'terminal').
4. In terminal type cd followed by a space and then the path to your folder. It should look like: 'cd Projects/C/Library' .
5. Once terminal is addressing the correct folder, type 'make' . Some compilation commands should run. 
6. Once terminal finished compiling the program, type './maind'. 
7. The program now runs and you can see which functions this program is calculating.
